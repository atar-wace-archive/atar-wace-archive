    <p>
        The atar-wace-archive is no longer operating as of 2022-08-21 due to a
        takedown request from the authority.

        Thank you for the support for this website over the years.<br />
        I made the site in June of 2020 because I felt like procrastinating by
        doing a programming project, and also wanted to get more practice papers
        for my exam revision.<br />
        Turns out the project paid off especially for chemistry, where I got a
        very high mark. And people actually used it which is very surprising
        considering I did no marketing for the site, except for some basic SEO
        in Google's search console.

        At least this means I no longer need to update the `root.json` file
        every year, finally can leave this jank mess of bash scripts, ruby and
        old JS frameworks in the past (Pro tip - don't use bash scripts with sed
        and grep for web parsing). This was really the only project from
        high-school that I occasionaly update (It's 2022 and it's been 2 years
        since end of HS and WACE for me), so I guess it's nice to finally tie up
        that part of my life and move on to other janky electrical and computer
        science projects at uni (Follow me on github!).

        I wish everyone the best in their ATAR exams and their future.<br />

        Personal update: WACE is done for me and I'm leaving with a cool ATAR of
        99.25. Yesterday I've also been told I got my first preference through TISC.
        Thank you to everyone who has helped me obtain the bread and achieve this
        win.
