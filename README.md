Please read the notice on the website.

archive of past papers from the old system and ATAR :)
The site hosts papers going as far back as 2006 and has papers which are no longer hosted on the official SCSA website.
You can also bulk-download papers by getting a command generated by the site, in powershell and bash with cURL.

This project could not have been possible without the Internet Archive, who hosts all the files - this site is only an interface to access these files easier.
