archive of past papers from the old system and ATAR :)

This project could not have been possible without the Internet Archive, who hosts all the files - this site is only an interface to access these files easier.  
File icons: https://github.com/dmhendricks/file-icon-vectors  
JS File tree structure: https://www.jstree.com/

This repository hosts the website: scripts used to bulk download and validate the files will be released soon(TM)
